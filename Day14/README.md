# 🧠 Day 14 — Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### 🎯 Objective
Understand how Support Vector Machines classify data using **hyperplanes** and **kernel transformations**.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered

### 1. What is an SVM?
A powerful ML algorithm that tries to find the **best separating hyperplane** between classes.

It maximizes the **margin**:

\[
\text{Margin} = \text{distance between support vectors and the hyperplane}
\]

### 2. Types of SVM
- **Linear SVM** → Works when data is linearly separable  
- **Kernel SVM** → Maps data to higher dimensions (RBF, polynomial)

### 3. Advantages
- Works great on high-dimensional data  
- Robust and accurate  
- Effective for small/medium datasets  

### 4. Kernels Used
- `linear`
- `rbf` (Gaussian kernel)
- `poly`
