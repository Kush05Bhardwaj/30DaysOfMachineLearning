# 🎉 Day 30 — Final Recap & Portfolio Showcase
### 🧠 30 Days of Applied AI & ML Completed ✅

---

## 🎯 Mission Recap  
In 30 days, I built a strong foundation in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**, covering:  
- Search Algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*)  
- Supervised Learning (Regression & Classification)  
- Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, PCA, t-SNE)  
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix)  
- Hyperparameter Tuning & Pipelines  
- Capstone Implementation  
- Model Saving & Deployment Readiness

## 📘 Major Highlights  
| Day | Milestone |
|-----|----------|
| 2–5 | Implemented BFS, DFS, A* for maze solving |
| 6–7 | Built regression from scratch + sklearn comparison |
| 8–12 | Trained classification models, evaluated with metrics |
| 13–22 | Performed clustering, PCA, neural network foundations |
| 23–27 | Trained RL agent (Q-Learning, CartPole Gym) |
| 28–29 | Built Capstone — **AI Maze Solver with A\*** |
| 30 | Polished, documented, and prepared for deployment |

## 🧬 Final Capstone Summary — AI Maze Solver  
✅ Maze grid: **20 × 20** with 120 random walls  
✅ Algorithm used: **A\*** (A-star) Search  
✅ Heuristic: **Manhattan Distance**  
✅ Output: Optimal path + node exploration benchmark saved in JSON logs  

### 🚀 Deployment-Ready Artifacts  
- Model saved using `joblib`  
- Performance logs saved as `Day29_Log.json`  
- Ready to integrate into API (Flask / FastAPI) or dashboards (Streamlit)

## 🧠 Skills Unlocked  
- End-to-End ML Development  
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Feature Engineering  
- Distance-Based, Tree-Based, and Probabilistic ML  
- Model Selection & Validation

## 🌟 Next Steps After 30 Days  
I plan to continue with deployment and advanced exploration:

1. **Containerize model API** using Docker  
2. Deploy on cloud (Render / Railway / AWS EC2)  
3. Build a **Streamlit Dashboard** for showcasing results  
4. Explore **XGBoost, Transformers, LLM fine-tuning**  
5. Maintain a learning log + push to GitHub regularly  
6. Share results on **LinkedIn**
