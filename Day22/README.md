# 🔗 Day 22 — ML Pipelines (End-to-End Workflow)

### 🎯 Objective
Learn how to combine preprocessing + model training into a single **scikit-learn pipeline** for clean, production-quality ML workflows.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered

### ⭐ What is a Pipeline?
A pipeline is a sequence of steps:
- Preprocessing (scaling, encoding…)
- Feature engineering
- Model training

Everything happens **in order**, ensuring consistency during training and prediction.

## 🧩 Why Pipelines Matter?
- Prevent data leakage  
- Clean, readable code  
- Perfect for production  
- Automatic preprocessing on new data
