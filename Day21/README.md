# 🔧 Day 21 — Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)

### 🎯 Objective
Learn how to optimize ML model performance using **GridSearchCV** and explore different combinations of hyperparameters.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered

### 1. What Are Hyperparameters?
Values **set before training**:
- C (regularization)
- Gamma (kernel coefficient)
- Kernel type (linear / rbf / poly)

Correct tuning can drastically change model accuracy.

## ⭐ Method Used: GridSearchCV
This technique:
- Tries all possible combinations of parameters  
- Performs cross-validation  
- Returns the **best model** and **best parameters**

## 🧠 Why Hyperparameter Tuning?
- Prevents underfitting/overfitting  
- Maximizes generalization  
- Makes your model production-ready
