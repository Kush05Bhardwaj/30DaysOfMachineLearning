# 📊 Day 15 — Model Comparison (Classification Algorithms)

### 🎯 Objective
Compare multiple ML algorithms on the **same dataset** to understand:
- Which model performs best?
- How metrics vary across algorithms?
- How to choose models for real-world problems?

---

## 📘 Models Compared
1. Logistic Regression  
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
3. Decision Tree  
4. Random Forest  
5. Naive Bayes  
6. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## 🧠 Why Compare Models?
Different models:
- Perform differently on different datasets  
- Have different strengths (speed, accuracy, generalization)  
- Show different bias–variance tradeoffs  

Model comparison helps identify:
- Most accurate model
- Most stable model
- Best model for deployment

---

## 🧪 Metrics Used
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  

### Visualization
- Bar chart comparing accuracy of all models  
- Confusion matrix of the best model
