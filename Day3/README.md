# 🧹 Day 3 — Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning

Data preprocessing is the **foundation of every ML project**.  
Today, we’ll learn to clean, scale, and transform raw data into a usable format.

---

## 🎯 Topics Covered
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical data  
- Feature scaling (Standardization / Normalization)  
- Splitting data into train/test sets

## 🧠 Why It Matters
Most datasets are messy — containing missing, inconsistent, or non-numeric values.  
Models perform poorly if data isn’t prepared properly.  
Hence, **“Garbage in → Garbage out”** 🗑️➡️🤖
