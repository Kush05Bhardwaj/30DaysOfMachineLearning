# 🐍 Day 2 — Python Basics for Machine Learning

Today’s goal: Brush up on **Python essentials** for data science and ML.

---

## 🎯 Topics Covered
- Variables, Data Types, and Lists
- Loops and Conditionals
- Functions and Imports
- Numpy Basics
- Pandas Basics

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters
Before diving into algorithms, ML developers need strong foundations in **data manipulation** using Python libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas** — since ML is 80% about data.

---

## 🧩 Practice Ideas
1. Create a NumPy array and calculate its mean, max, min.  
2. Make a Pandas DataFrame for student marks and compute the average.  
3. Load a CSV file and display basic stats (`.describe()`).
