## 💡 Capstone Ideas (Pick One)
1. **AI Maze Solver** — BFS, DFS, A* with GUI visualization + API
2. **Smart Customer Segmentation** — PCA + Clustering + Dashboard
3. **RL + Path Recommendation** — Q-Learning agent suggesting optimal paths
4. **Hybrid Titanic Analyzer** — EDA + SHAP explainability + API deployment
5. **Image Classifier Suite** — CNN in PyTorch, model export, API inference
