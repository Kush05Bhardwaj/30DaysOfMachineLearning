## 🧠 1. What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science focused on **creating systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence** — such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

Instead of following explicit instructions, AI systems **learn from data and experience** to improve over time.

> 🧩 **Example:**  
> - Google Maps predicting traffic  
> - ChatGPT generating natural conversations  
> - Self-driving cars recognizing pedestrians

## 🧮 4. Subfields of AI

| Subfield | Description | Example |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Machine Learning (ML)** | Systems that learn patterns from data | House price prediction |
| **Deep Learning (DL)** | Neural networks with multiple layers | Image & speech recognition |
| **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** | Understanding & generating human language | Chatbots, translators |
| **Computer Vision** | Visual data analysis | Face detection, OCR |
| **Robotics** | AI for motion & control | Drones, warehouse robots |
| **Expert Systems** | Rule-based decision-making | Medical diagnosis system |
| **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** | Learning via rewards & penalties | Game agents, pathfinding |

---

## 📘 5. What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that allows systems to **learn patterns from data** and make predictions or decisions **without being explicitly programmed**.

In ML, we don’t write specific rules — instead, the model learns from examples.

> 🧩 Example:  
> Instead of coding "what a cat looks like," we give the model thousands of cat images — it learns to recognize patterns automatically.

## 🧩 6. Types of Machine Learning

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Supervised Learning** | Model learns from labeled data. | Predicting house prices |
| **Unsupervised Learning** | Model finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data. | Customer segmentation |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | Agent learns by interacting with an environment using rewards/punishments. | Self-driving car learning to stay in lane |

## ⚙️ 7. Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Collection** → Gather relevant data  
2. **Data Preprocessing** → Clean, scale, handle missing values  
3. **Model Training** → Feed processed data into algorithm  
4. **Evaluation** → Measure model performance (accuracy, precision, etc.)  
5. **Deployment** → Integrate model into real-world use  
6. **Monitoring** → Track performance over time  

📈 **Example:**  
You collect house price data → train regression model → test → deploy → monitor predictions.

## ⚙️ 10. The Modern AI Pipeline

```bash
Data → Model → Training → Evaluation → Deployment → Monitoring
```

- **Data:** Raw information (text, images, numbers)  
- **Model:** Algorithm that learns patterns  
- **Training:** Adjusting parameters using data  
- **Evaluation:** Checking accuracy or error metrics  
- **Deployment:** Integrating into apps or APIs  
- **Monitoring:** Ensuring consistent performance in real-world use
