# 🎨 Day 16 — K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)

### 🎯 Objective
Understand how **K-Means** groups unlabeled data into clusters and visualize them.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered
### What is Clustering?
Unsupervised technique that groups similar data points.

### K-Means Algorithm Steps
1. Choose number of clusters K  
2. Randomly initialize centroids  
3. Assign points to nearest centroid  
4. Recompute centroids  
5. Repeat until convergence  

### Important Concepts
- **Centroid**  
- **Inertia / SSE (Sum of Squared Errors)**  
- **Elbow Method** (Find best K)
