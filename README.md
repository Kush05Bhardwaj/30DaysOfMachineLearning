# 🚀 30 Days of Machine Learning — Phase 1

Welcome to my **30 Days of Machine Learning (Phase 1)** challenge!  
This repository documents my daily journey into the world of **ML fundamentals, data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation** — one step at a time.  

Each day, I’ll push new code, notes, or mini-projects — focusing on consistency and learning by doing.  
Let’s go from **beginner to confident ML practitioner** — one commit at a time. 💪
